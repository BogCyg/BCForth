VARIABLE REC_FACTORIAL


: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! )	DUP 
			1 > 	IF	DUP 1- 				\ n n-1
					REC_FACTORIAL @EXECUTE 		\ recursively call FACTORIAL(n-1)
					*				\ then mult the result
				THEN ;


\ This will store adr of FACTORIAL in REC_FACTORIAL
\ which, in turn, is called in... FACTORIAL - hence the recursion
' FACTORIAL REC_FACTORIAL !

\ Now we can call FACTORIAL, first placing n on the stack
